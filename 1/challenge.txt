1. Find two numbers that add up to 2020, and multiply them together.

I'll try by having a fixed target (2020), subtracting a number, and checking if the remainder exists in the list.
If it does, then we found the solution! Otherwise, move on to the next number and try again.

2. Find three numbers that add up to 2020, and multiply them together.

Extended above solution - got remainder from two subtractions and checked for presence in input.
